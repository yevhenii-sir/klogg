## Overview

Klogg is a multi-platform GUI application that helps browse and search
through long and complex log files. It is designed with programmers and
system administrators in mind and can be seen as a graphical, interactive
combination of grep, less, and tail.

Please refer to the
[technical documentation](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
page for how to use Klogg.

## About the Project

Klogg started as a fork of [glogg](https://github.com/nickbnf/glogg) - the fast, smart log explorer in 2016.

Since then it has evolved from fixing small annoying bugs to rewriting core components to
make it faster and smarter that predecessor.

Development of klogg is driven by features my colleagues and I need
to stay productive as well as feature requests from users on Github and in glogg mailing list.

Latest news about klogg development can be found at https://klogg.filimonov.dev.

### Comparing with glogg

Klogg has all best features of glogg:

* Runs on Unix-like systems, Windows and Mac thanks to Qt5
* Is fast and reads the file directly from disk, without loading it into memory
* Can operate on huge text files (10+ Gb is not a problem)
* Search results are displayed separately from original file
* Supports Perl-compatible regular expressions
* Colorizes the log and search results
* Displays a context view of where in the log the lines of interest are
* Watches for file changes on disk and reloads it (kind of like tail)
* Is open source, released under the GPL

And on top of that klogg:

* Is heavily optimized using multi-threading and SIMD
* Supports files with more than 2147483647 lines
* Includes optimized regular expressions search; benchmark details live in [docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md](docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md)
* Allows combining regular expressions with boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
* Supports many common text encodings
* Detects file encoding automatically using [uchardet](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/) library (supports utf8, utf16, cp1251 and more) 
* Can limit search operations to some part of huge file
* Allows to configure several highlighters sets and switch between them
* Has a list of configurable predefined regular expression patterns
* Includes a dark mode
* Has configurable shortcuts
* Has a scratchpad window for taking notes and doing basic data transformations
* Provides lots of small features that make life easier (closing tabs, copying file paths, favorite files menu, etc.)

List of glogg issues that have been fixed/implemented in klogg can be found [here](https://github.com/ZEACENT/klogg/discussions/302).

List of all changes can be found [here](https://github.com/ZEACENT/klogg/milestone/8?closed=1).

## Installation

This project uses [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/). For a list of available versions, see the [repository tag list](https://github.com/ZEACENT/klogg/tags).

### Current stable release builds

Binaries for all platforms can be downloaded from GitHub releases.

[ ![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ZEACENT/klogg?style=flat)](https://github.com/ZEACENT/klogg/releases/latest)

#### Windows
Windows installer is also available from:

* [ ![Chocolatey](https://img.shields.io/chocolatey/v/klogg?style=flat)](https://chocolatey.org/packages/klogg)
* [ ![Scoop Extras bucket](https://img.shields.io/scoop/v/klogg?bucket=extras)](https://scoopsearch.github.io/#/apps?q=klogg)
* [Winget package](https://winget.run/pkg/ZEACENT/klogg) 

#### Mac OS
Package for Mac can be installed from Homebrew

[ ![homebrew cask](https://img.shields.io/homebrew/cask/v/klogg?style=flat)](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/klogg)

#### Linux
It is recommended to use klogg package from distribution-specific [repositories](https://repology.org/project/klogg/versions).

Generic packages are available from klogg DEB and RPM repositories hosted at GitHub Pages.
They are built to run on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04 and Oracle Linux 7/8 (x86-64 only).

For DEB packages first download the gpg key:
```
curl -sS https://klogg.filimonov.dev/klogg.gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/klogg.gpg
```

You might need to manually create `/etc/apt/keyrings` directory.

Then download the repository list file for you distribution (replace `<ubuntu_release>` with one of `bionic`, `focal`, `jammy`):
```
curl -sS https://klogg.filimonov.dev/deb/klogg.<ubuntu_release>.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/klogg.list
```

Finally, install using apt
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install klogg
```

If there is already an entry for JFrogg hosted klogg repository in `/etc/apt/sources.list`, then remove this line from it:
```
deb [trusted=yes] https://favpackage.jfrog.io/artifactory/klogg_deb/ <ubuntu_release> utils
```

For RPM download klogg repo file (replace `<oracle_release>` with one of `7`, `8`):
```
curl -sS https://klogg.filimonov.dev/rpm/klogg-oracle-<oracle_release>.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/klogg-rpm.repo
```

Then install using yum
```
sudo yum update
sudo yum install klogg
```

There is also an AppImage package that can be used without installation. To run klogg from AppImage, download the package and make in executable with either a file manager or terminal command `chmod +x <path_to_klogg_AppImage>` and then run the AppImage file.

AppImage uses FUSE2 and Ubuntu 22.04 has moved away from FUSE2 into FUSE3 and therefore you need to install the necessary package to enable compatibility with FUSE2 `sudo apt install libfuse2`.

As indicated by this link from the official appimage documentation: https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/fuse.html#setting-up-fuse-2-x-alongside-of-fuse-3-x-on-recent-ubuntu-22-04-debian-and-their-derivatives

## Building

Please review
[docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md)
for how to setup Klogg on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Regex Benchmark Snapshot

Regular-expression benchmark methodology now lives in [docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md](docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md). The current snapshot was refreshed on March 1, 2026 across `simple`, `normal`, and `complex` regex profiles with `50MB`, `500MB`, and `5GB` tmpfs-backed corpora, comparing `Qt`, `Vectorscan generic`, and `Vectorscan AVX` builds.

500MB median search time snapshot:

| Profile | Qt (ms) | Vectorscan generic (ms) | Vectorscan AVX (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `simple` | 523.41 | 169.98 | 169.92 |
| `normal` | 690.74 | 186.47 | 180.23 |
| `complex` | 1071.93 | 219.07 | 204.00 |

The full matrix, throughput tables, regex contents, and fairness counters (`searched lines`, `matches`, `hit rate`) live in [docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.md](docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.md) and [docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.json](docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.json).
