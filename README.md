## Overview

Klogg is a multi-platform GUI application that helps browse and search
through long and complex log files. It is designed with programmers and
system administrators in mind and can be seen as a graphical, interactive
combination of grep, less, and tail.

Please refer to the
[technical documentation](docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
page for how to use Klogg.

A [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) tracks monthly changes.

## About the Project

Klogg started as a fork of [glogg](https://github.com/nickbnf/glogg) - the fast, smart log explorer in 2016.

Since then it has evolved from fixing small annoying bugs to rewriting core components to
make it faster and smarter than its predecessor.

### Comparing with glogg

Klogg has all the best features of glogg:

* Runs on Unix-like systems, Windows and Mac thanks to Qt5/Qt6
* Is fast and reads the file directly from disk, without loading it into memory
* Can operate on huge text files (10+ Gb is not a problem)
* Search results are displayed separately from original file
* Supports Perl-compatible regular expressions
* Colorizes the log and search results
* Displays a context view of where in the log the lines of interest are
* Watches for file changes on disk and reloads it (kind of like tail)
* Is open source, released under the GPL

And on top of that klogg:

* Is heavily optimized using multi-threading and SIMD
* Supports files with more than 2147483647 lines
* Includes optimized regular expressions search; benchmark details live in [docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md](docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md)
* Allows combining regular expressions with boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
* Supports many common text encodings
* Detects file encoding automatically using [uchardet](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/) library (supports utf8, utf16, cp1251 and more)
* Can limit search operations to some part of huge file
* Allows configuring several highlighter sets and switching between them
* Has a list of configurable predefined regular expression patterns
* Includes a dark mode
* Has configurable shortcuts
* Has a scratchpad window for taking notes and doing basic data transformations
* Provides lots of small features that make life easier (closing tabs, copying file paths, favorite files menu, etc.)

List of glogg issues that have been fixed/implemented in klogg can be found [here](https://github.com/ZEACENT/klogg/discussions/302).

### Comparing with variar/klogg

This fork builds on [variar/klogg](https://github.com/variar/klogg) and adds:

* **iOS live log streaming** — device discovery and log capture via pymobiledevice3
* **Android logcat live streaming** — ADB-based logcat with persistent-file save mode
* **ANSI color rendering** — configurable output modes (strip / render / plain) for live streams
* **Live-source search throttling** — smooth UI during streaming without blocking the event loop
* **Search generation IDs** — monotonic counter prevents stale search results after interrupting a search (see [PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md))
* **Batched flush** — triple-threshold output flushing (64 KB / 100 lines / 1 s) for live log captures
* **Highlighter coexistence** — selection highlighting preserves keyword highlighter colors
* **Status bar pending indicator** — shows pending search lines as `Ln:X/Y (+N pending)`
* **Platform-aware tool resolution** — robust external-tool discovery across macOS launchd, Windows, and Linux (see [PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md))

## Installation

This project uses [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/). For a list of available versions, see the [repository tag list](https://github.com/ZEACENT/klogg/tags).

Binaries for all platforms are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZEACENT/klogg/releases/latest).

### Continuous builds

| Windows | Linux | Mac |

## Building

Please review
[docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md)
for how to set up Klogg on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Regex Benchmark Snapshot

Regular-expression benchmark methodology now lives in [docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md](docs/REGEX_BENCHMARKS.md). The current snapshot was refreshed on March 1, 2026 across `simple`, `normal`, and `complex` regex profiles with `50MB`, `500MB`, and `5GB` tmpfs-backed corpora, comparing `Qt`, `Vectorscan generic`, and `Vectorscan AVX` builds.

500MB median search time snapshot:

| Profile | Qt (ms) | Vectorscan generic (ms) | Vectorscan AVX (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `simple` | 523.41 | 169.98 | 169.92 |
| `normal` | 690.74 | 186.47 | 180.23 |
| `complex` | 1071.93 | 219.07 | 204.00 |

The full matrix, throughput tables, regex contents, and fairness counters (`searched lines`, `matches`, `hit rate`) live in [docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.md](docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.md) and [docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.json](docs/benchmarks/regex-benchmark-results.json).
